# About

Hello! I am Sheen Patel, a third-year student at the University of Toronto pursuing a Bachelorsâ€™ in civil engineering. My interest in civil engineering started when I was young, with bridges and a love for rail and transportation systems. As I pursue my degree and gain experience in the field, I am appreciative of the interactions between the built environment and the public, which civil engineering greatly affects. In my career, I hope that I have the opportunity to work on projects that further the quality of life of those around me.
As an ambitious and team-oriented student leader, I have developed project management skills, using industry leading tools like Gantt charts and Microsoft Project. I am also a strong communicator as a co-captain of the Concrete Toboggan Design Team and Drum Major of a marching band. My main areas of interest are in concrete material research and geotechnical engineering. Apart from civil engineering, I also enjoy programming with C and Swift, as well as producing electronic music.
